A sanitized repo for networked action situations survey data

This repository contains de-identified data and code for the manuscript "Engagement in Water Governance Action Situations in the Lake Champlain Basin", published in PLOS ONE.

The permenant home for the data is on the UNL Data Repository, for which I do not have a URL at the moment. I will update this as that information is released.
